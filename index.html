    <h1>My Favorite food Biryani</h1>
        <p>Biryani is a mixed rice dish originating among the Muslims of South Asia. It is made with
            Indian spices, vegetables, rice, and usually some type of meat (chicken, beef, goat, lamb, prawn, and fish),
            or in some cases without any meat,[1] and sometimes, in addition, eggs and potatoes.[2]Biryani is one of the most popular dishes in South Asia, as well as among the diaspora from the region.
            Similar dishes are also prepared in other parts of the world such as in Iraq, Myanmar, Thailand, and
            Malaysia.[3] Biryani is the single most-ordered dish on Indian online food ordering and delivery services,
            and has been labelled as the most popular dish overall in India</p>

        <h1>My Favorite Hero Pspk</h1>
        <p>Kalyan started his political career in 2008[51] as the president of Yuvarajyam,[52] the youth wing of Praja
            Rajyam Party which was started by his elder brother Chiranjeevi. He neither contested in elections nor did
            he hold any constitutional post during his days in Praja Rajyam Party. While he actively campaigned for the
            party, he was also hit with few health problems. Kalyan was struck with bouts of vomiting, as he was hit by
            a sunstroke during a roadshow at Vizag on 19 April 2009.[53] Later, in 2011, when Chiranjeevi merged his
            party[54] with Congress,[55] Kalyan took a break from political life, expressing his silent discontent with
            his brother's decision to merge the party,[56] and started a new political party in 2014 called Jana Sena
            Party.</p>

        <h1>My favorite Heroine Anuksha</h1>
        <p>er first film release in 2017 was Si3, in which she was paired with Suriya for the third time in her
            career.[71] In Om Namo Venkatesaya Shetty portrayed Krishnamma, a Goda Devi or Andal-inspired character. Her
            next release was Baahubali 2: The Conclusion. Shetty received a positive response for her portrayal of
            Yuvarani Devasena.[72][73][74] The character of Devasena was highly praised by critics and Shetty's
            portrayal was equally lauded. A Firstpost article noted that the female characters in the second part were
            the actual heroes of the saga. Comparing Devasena to Arjuna, the article described her as "a competitive
            warrior who can wield the bow and arrow with finesse". It further noted how her character emphasized the
            need of freedom of choice writing that "in Devasena's case by taking archery lessons, choosing her life
            partner and being given the right to reject a matrimonial alliance, she can be her own person and develop
            into a strong personality, who doesn't break down even when chained for 25 years in the palace courtyard."
            She earned her seventh nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Actress – Telugu for her performance in
            Baahubali 2:</p>
